# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Peer-to-Peer-Lending
he following Exploratory analysis has been done on a dataset provided by The Lending Club which was one of the first companies to have started Peer to Peer Lending. P2P lending websites provide a platform that directly connects borrowers to investors. For lenders, P2P lending is a way to generate income on their cash at a rate that exceeds those offered by conventional savings accounts. The loan applicant posts a financial profile that is assigned a risk category that determines the interest rate the applicant will pay. Most P2P lending sites have a wide range of interest rates based on the creditworthiness of the applicant. The rates for applicants with good credit are often lower than comparable bank rates, while rates for applicants with sketchy credit records may go much higher. However, the default rates of P2P lending make it an interesting case to study and ponder whether the returns are worth the risk.
